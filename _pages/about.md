I research, design, and build interactive techniques and systems for emerging technologies and products.

I am the Digital Experience Lead at Fujitsu, where I build solutions for Digital Twins, XR, and Generative AI technologies.
Previously, I was a Senior HCI researcher at Huawei Canada, creating novel human interfaces and intuitive user experiences for mobile devices, wearables, and vehicles.
In the earlier days, I was building marker-less motion capture solutions using computer vision and deep learning, as well as digital human embodiment in VR.

I received my PhD from Keio University in Tokyo, Japan.
My advisors were [Prof. Masahiko Inami](https://www.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/research/people/staff-inami_masahiko.html) and [Prof. Kouta Minamizawa](https://www.kmd.keio.ac.jp/faculty/kouta-minamizawa).
My research in HCI is at the intersection of interactive simulations and emerging interfaces, including mobiles, wearables, XR, vehicles, smart home, and Generative AI.
My [research page](https://kevinfan.com/research/) demonstrates some examples of my work.
