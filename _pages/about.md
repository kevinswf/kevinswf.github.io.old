I am the Digital Experience Lead at Fujitsu, where I research, design, and build solutions utilzing Digital Twins, XR, and Generative AI technologies.
Before Fujitsu, I was a Senior HCI researcher at Huawei Canada, creating interactive techniques and intellectual properties for emerging technology and products.
In the earlier days, I was building markerless motion capture solutions using computer vision and deep learning, and also digital human embodiment in VR.
I obtained my PhD at Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.
My advisors were [Prof. Masahiko Inami](https://www.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/research/people/staff-inami_masahiko.html) and [Prof. Kouta Minamizawa](https://www.kmd.keio.ac.jp/faculty/kouta-minamizawa).
My research in HCI is at the intersection of XR and emerging products (mobiles/wearables/smart vehicles/IoT/GenAI).
Please see my [research page](https://kevinfan.com/research/) for some examples of my work.
